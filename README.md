## Academic Research & Scientific Writing

### Quantum Computing & Drug Discovery Debate Project
**Repository:**  
Hosts the **full debate write-up, slide deck materials, and references** from a technical research analysis evaluating the feasibility of quantum-enabled drug discovery within the next decade. I led the technical “against” position focusing on algorithmic scaling, resource estimation, and hardware feasibility. Our team debate concluded 6–3 in favor of the “against” position.
